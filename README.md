## What is #code-talk?
Simply put it, it's a channel where developers, both beginners and professionals, can share, help and have conversations in. Whilst primarily aimed at Discord Bot development, you can also get help regarding development outside of Discord, e.g. APIs, frontend and hardware, applications etc as well as resources/information regarding development. The community here are mostly comprised of people who are knowledgable at JavaScript and TypeScript, however there are also users who are proficient at other languages as well.
